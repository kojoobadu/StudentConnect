StudentConnect is an app which allows students on campus to create accounts using their .edu email accounts and it allows
Students to buy and sell tickets. THe application will be developed using the android OS platform.
Our app will be connected to a database using volley which will allow our users to login and access their information.
Initially we plan to use the information we have learn so far to develop the architecture.
We plan to decompose the project into several smaller modules which can be implemented independently.
Initially, we will also develop the functional and non functional requirements of our application.
We all have adequate experience using android studio which can be applied to the success of our application.
